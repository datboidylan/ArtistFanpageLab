            <h3>Why I like their Music</h3>
            <p>The reason I enjoy this artist is because their music is very good to me i enjoy listening to them and jam out to everyone of their songs and sometimes I can just vibe out to their music and really focus they have simple bars but they are funny and meaningful I also am a big weeb so I love all the anime references that are in their songs I feel like I can connect to it better</p>

            <h3>My Favorite song</h3>
            <p>Even though I enjoy all their songs their is still my favorites. My Favorite song by MC Virgins is "Caught simpin'" ft lil boom. 
                This is my favorite song because it has very chill vibes and also I am a big simp so I naturally like it. 
                The song goes in detail about the different types of guys, we have the simps, the chads, 
                and the loners that dont need no girl. I think this song has quite the deep meaning to it with it talking about
                 the men and how no matter what you do the girl is never satisified even when you genuinely care about their feelings </p>
